interface_elements
==================
Tried to add some of the elements of jquery mobile interface.
in this example i used "grid layout" and fullscreen setting along with a header and buttons.

recorded sounds on a midi-keabord and exported as mp3s,. Runs smoothly on my computer but with delays on my phone
